  Scenario Outline: As a tester I require the ability to pass Decelerometer test
    Given I am logged in as a Tester
    And I start an Mot Test with a Class 4 Vehicle
    And the Tester adds an Odometer Reading of 1000 mi
    And the Tester adds a Class 3-7 Decelerometer Brake Test Result with custom <scenario>
    And the Tester Passes the Mot Test
    Then the Mot test status should be <status>
    Examples:
      | scenario                                   | status |
      | class4.decelerometer.commercial.valid.high | PASSED |
      | class4.decelerometer.commercial.valid.low  | PASSED |
      | class4.decelerometer.goods.valid.high      | PASSED |
      | class4.decelerometer.valid.high            | PASSED |
      | class4.decelerometer.valid.low             | PASSED |

  @brake-test
  Scenario: RFR added if all wheels are under the 30% efficiency threshold and none have locked
    Given I am a Tester performing an MOT Test on a Class 4 Vehicle
    When I submit brake test results with all service brake controls under 30% efficiency and no wheels locked
    Then the "Service brake performance" - "efficiency below requirements" RFR should have been added

  @brake-test
  Scenario: RFR not added if one or more wheels is under the 30% efficiency threshold but it has locked
    Given I am a Tester performing an MOT Test on a Class 4 Vehicle
    When I submit brake test results with all service brake controls under 30% efficiency and wheels locked
    Then the "Service brake performance" - "efficiency below requirements" RFR should not have been added

  @brake-test
  Scenario: Putting vehicle weight in brake test does not update vehicle record for demo test
    Given I am logged in as a Tester
    And I start a Demo MOT Test
    And the Tester adds an Odometer Reading
    When the Tester adds a Class 3-7 Plate Brake Test
    And the Tester Passes the Mot Test
    Then vehicle weight is not updated

  @brake-test
  Scenario: If vehicle weight source (type) is "official" and vehicle weight and vehicle weight source has changed,
  update vehicle weight and vehicle weight source on vehicle record
    Given I am a Tester performing an MOT Test on a Class 4 Vehicle
    When I submit brake test results with vehicle weight of 1200 and vehicle weight source of MISW
    And the Tester Passes the Mot Test
    Then vehicle weight is updated
    And vehicle weight source is updated
