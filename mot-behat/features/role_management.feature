  Scenario Outline: A scheme manager adds a role to another user
    When I am logged in as a <manager>
    And I add the role of "<role_name>" to another user
    Then the user's RBAC will have the role "<role_name>"
    And a status change event is generated for the user of "Role Association Change"
    And an event description contains my name
    And an event description contains phrase "<role_full_name>"
    And the user will receive a "DVSA Assign Role" notification
    And a notification subject contains phrase "<role_full_name>"
  Examples:
    | manager                  | role_name                         | role_full_name             |
    | Scheme Manager           | DVSA-SCHEME-MANAGEMENT            | Scheme manager             |
